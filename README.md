**Title:** Sample Capstone Machine Learning Submission Template (Python)

**Description:**

This repository provides a sample Jupyter Notebook template specifically designed for capstone machine learning projects using Python.  The template guides you through the essential steps of the machine learning workflow, helping you structure your capstone project effectively.

**Benefits:**

* **Structured Approach:** Ensures a clear and organized project structure, facilitating communication and evaluation.
* **Capstone-Specific:** Focuses on key stages relevant to capstone projects, including problem definition, data exploration, model selection, and result interpretation.
* **Commented Cells:** Provides explanations and guidance throughout the notebook, making it easier to follow and adapt.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahiamit1993/capstone_machine_learning.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   The specific dependencies will depend on the libraries used in the notebook. You can usually find them listed in the notebook itself or in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the notebook:**

   Use a Jupyter Notebook environment to open `Copy_of_Sample_ML_Submission_Template.ipynb`.

**Customize the Template:**

* **Define Your Capstone Problem:** Replace the placeholder problem statement with your specific capstone project's objective.
* **Load and Explore Your Data:** Adapt the data loading and exploration sections to work with your own dataset.
* **Choose and Implement a Model:** Select a suitable machine learning model based on your problem and data characteristics. 
* **Evaluate and Interpret Results:** Modify the evaluation metrics and incorporate your insights into the results interpretation.

**Note:**

* This template serves as a foundation for your capstone project. Feel free to modify and extend the notebook as needed.
* Consider including additional sections specific to your capstone project requirements, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, or hyperparameter tuning.

**Additional Information:**

* Welcome contributions to the template through pull requests to improve it for future users.
* If you have any questions, feel free to raise an issue on the repository.
